Reinforcement Learning in Tic-Tac-Toe
=====================================

My excursion into RL, as described in Sutton and Barto book. Several strategies are implemented:
MinMax (which you cannot beat), a couple hand-crafted strats with deficiencies that RL can hopefully
learn and exploit, and of course, RL strategy.

Inspired by:
https://github.com/tansey/rl-tictactoe.git

Code is refactored as we go, but hopefully you will find it reasonably structured.
